##Introduction

Hi, thanks so much for the introduction, and thank you for choosing to view my

## Session outcomes

So, what can you expect to get out of this Session?

Well, aside from the guaranteed 10XP, you have the chance to pick up a Rare or even Epic tip on how to develop a plan for your open source career that's in alignment with your personal values, that leverages your personal strengths and which addresses the skills you're not _quite_ legendary in yet.

We'll spend some time exploring how to learn more about what your superpowers are, and how you can grow new ones. We'll learn not just about the technical repertoire a kick-ass open source ninja has, but the conceptual and interpersonal skills required to level up your career. We'll look at skill trees so that you can build a path to follow in your professional development.

Pretty cruisy, right? But, dragons exist in real life too, and we'll explore tips and techniques to use when you suddenly find yourself at the bottom of a workplace dungeon.

## Game Plan

I'd like to ask you all a question.

 * How many of you knew, right from high school, that you wanted to be an open source developer?
 Great!

 * How many of you had a plan from high school to get the grades to get into Uni, take the right subjects, and then get the right job at the right company?
OK.

* And how many of you kind of fell into the role that you're in at the moment without any sort of defined career plan?
OK, I see

- and what might be a completely unrelated question - how many people here have played a role playing game like dungeons and dragons, or Magic the Gathering, or World of Warcraft, something like that ?

- [ ] need to have the habitrpg character here as a graphic

So, the first thing that you often do in those sorts of games is to work with your character - understand their strengths and weaknesses and then develop a game plan - a strategy - that your character can use to make the most of the environment they find themselves in and the resources they have around them.

Real life is very similar.

Any Minecraft fans in the audience? Do you remember the very first time that you played Minecraft? And you didn't chop down enough wood in time, and you didn't build a shelter, and the monsters came and ate you in the middle of the night?

Yeah, real life's kinda like that ;-)

That's right - you need a game plan for your career!

## Rolling your character

So, how do you find out what sort of character you are?

The fact that you're at a brilliant conference like this already suggests a few things - you're probably highly intelligent, interested in the way that things work, you may have a penchant for freedom, for analysis and deep technical interests.

That's all great, but we need to dig a little deeper to find out how knowing about your character can help you advance your career.

# Motivations

Different people - different characters - are motivated by different things.

There are two key types of motivators - external motivators - and intrinsic motivators

- [ ] need a key slide here around the different types of motivators - the Flickr one with the scrabble letters

- [ ] need to do a table here which shows the types of external and intrinsic motivators;

*Extrinsic motivations*

Extrinsic motivation means that the things which motivate us come from the outside. The desires to perform a task or reach a goal are driven by an outside source. Examples of extrinsic motivators include things like performance bonuses, other types of monetary rewards, recognition such as employee of the month awards, organised team activities and so on.

Without the external stimulus, you would be less likely to expend the effort or skill required to reach the goal.

Extrinsic motivation means that the individual's motivational stimuli are coming from outside. In other words, our desires to perform a task are controlled by an outside source. Note that even though the stimuli are coming from outside, the result of performing the task will still be rewarding for the individual performing the task.




## Skill trees

So, now that you know what sort of character you are, and what motivates you, how do you progress your career?

Let's take a look again at some examples from the gaming world.

- [ ] Insert slides here from the different skill trees found in games

Just like these different character classes, you have to have a defined plan - a skill tree - in order to level up.

Extrinsic versus intrinsic motivator table

Intrinsic Motivation

Intrinsic motivation means that the individual's motivational stimuli are coming from within. The individual has the desire to perform a specific task, because its results are in accordance with his belief system or fulfills a desire and therefore importance is attached to it.

Our deep-rooted desires have the highest motivational power. Below are some examples:

    Acceptance: We all need to feel that we, as well as our decisions, are accepted by our co-workers.
    Curiosity: We all have the desire to be in the know.
    Honor: We all need to respect the rules and to be ethical.
    Independence: We all need to feel we are unique.
    Order: We all need to be organized.
    Power: We all have the desire to be able to have influence.
    Social contact: We all need to have some social interactions.
    Social Status: We all have the desire to feel important.

Extrinsic Motivation

Extrinsic motivation means that the individual's motivational stimuli are coming from outside. In other words, our desires to perform a task are controlled by an outside source. Note that even though the stimuli are coming from outside, the result of performing the task will still be rewarding for the individual performing the task.

Extrinsic motivation is external in nature. The most well-known and the most debated motivation is money. Below are some other examples:

    Employee of the month award
    Benefit package
    Bonuses
    Organized activities
