## Session outcomes

So, what can you expect to get out of this Session?

Well, aside from the guaranteed 10XP, you have the chance to pick up a Rare or even Epic tip on how to develop a plan for your open source career that's in alignment with your personal values, that leverages your personal strengths and which addresses the skills you're not _quite_ legendary in yet.

We'll spend some time exploring how to learn more about what your superpowers are, and how you can grow new ones. We'll learn not just about the technical repertoire a kick-ass open source ninja has, but the conceptual and interpersonal skills required to level up your career. We'll look at skill trees so that you can build a path to follow in your professional development.

Pretty cruisy, right? But, dragons exist in real life too, and we'll explore tips and techniques to use when you suddenly find yourself at the bottom of a workplace dungeon.

## Game Plan

I'd like to ask you all a question.

 * How many of you knew, right from high school, that you wanted to be an open source developer?
 Great!

 * How many of you had a plan from high school to get the grades to get into Uni, take the right subjects, and then get the right job at the right company?
OK.

* And how many of you kind of fell into the role that you're in at the moment without any sort of defined career plan?
OK, I see

- and what might be a completely unrelated question - how many people here have played a role playing game like dungeons and dragons, or Magic the Gathering, or World of Warcraft, something like that ?

- [ ] need to have the habitrpg character here as a graphic

So, the first thing that you often do in those sorts of games is to work with your character - understand their strengths and weaknesses and then develop a game plan - a strategy - that your character can use to make the most of the environment they find themselves in and the resources they have around them.

Real life is very similar.

Any Minecraft fans in the audience? Do you remember the very first time that you played Minecraft? And you didn't chop down enough wood in time, and you didn't build a shelter, and the monsters came and ate you in the middle of the night?

That's right - you need a game plan for your career!

## Rolling your character

So, how do you find out what sort of character you are?

The fact that you're at a brilliant conference like this already suggests a few things - you're probably highly intelligent, interested in the way that things work, you may have a penchant for freedom, for analysis and deep technical interests.

That's all great
